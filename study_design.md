# Study Design

## Data Sources

Publicly available data on NYC..........

## Variables to evaluate

There are many ways to look at the data. Some of the simple but interesting ones would be looking at the dog intelligence for each grouping of dog--for example, are Hounds or Herding dogs more intelligent? There are many ways to slice this data, but I will rely mainly on the AKC standards in this study. However, I'm capturing other groups (such as the UK standards) in case others want to use this data to look at other relationships. I can also look at the intelligence of each animal grouped by their country of origin. Are certain regions of the world known for having more intelligent dogs? This will be a bit difficult since some countries might only have 1 or 2 dogs that come from the country, making it a result that is not statistically significant. Given enough time to properly clean the data, I will also build on existing research that finds that larger dogs tend to be more intelligent by taking height and weight into account for each dog.

## Relationships to explore

Once I've brought in all the data and packaged it, I will start looking at relationships between the data sets. The highlight of the project will be determining cities' "dog IQ scores." Combining the registration data for NY, Adelaide, and Edmonton with the dog intelligence scores, I can find a city's mean dog IQ. I will do this for each borough in NY as well as the other two cities. I will then incorporate US census data and determine if there are trends in the data there. I will look at age groups, employment information, and other aspects of the census data and determine if there is a relationship between those factors and the breakdown of particular dog breeds.

## Future analysis

I've requested voting data for this set, meaning that I will be able to look at what kinds of dogs Republicans, Democrats, and Independent voters prefer.

## Notes on the data

Staten Island data is unavailable
Male data was used for dog height and weight
For lowest category of dog intelligence, "obey" was not specified. I am assigning a value of 0.10
Edmonton had almost no data for 2016 and very little for 2017, so I'm using 2018 data
Removing "miniature" from the dataset.
For further research, someone could use the census tract data in the NYC dataset.
Extracting the first number from the height/weight for simplicity.
