# Project Notes

Staten Island data is unavailable
Male data was used for dog height and weight
For lowest category of dog intelligence, "obey" was not specified. I am assigning a value of 0.10
Edmonton had almost no data for 2016 and very little for 2017, so I'm using 2018 data
Removing "miniature" from the dataset.
For further research, someone could use the census tract data in the NYC dataset.
Extracting the first number from the height/weight for simplicity.
