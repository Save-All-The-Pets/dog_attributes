## Notes on the data

Staten Island census data is unavailable
For lowest category of dog intelligence, "obey" was not specified. I am assigning a value of 0.10
Edmonton had almost no data for 2016 and very little for 2017, so I'm using 2018 data.
Pulling data from Wikipedia, of course, allows for a small margin of error in the data; however, the data is usually accurate.
Terriers and Toy Terriers were treated as Terriers and Toys in the AKC rankings.
American/English Cocker Spaniel
Compliance could affect the data; certain dog owners may be less likely to register their dogs even though it's required in all three localities.
Mixed breeds were not categorized, and were thus excluded.
Dogs were double-counted for origin.
